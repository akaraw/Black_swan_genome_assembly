# Black swan genome assembly
#Intro:
This repository contains the scripts used for black swan (Cygnus atratus) genome assembly using PacBio long reads sequence data. The black swan gneome was constructed as a part of a project investigating genesis and pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Australian black swans. The study was conducted at the University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, 4027.
